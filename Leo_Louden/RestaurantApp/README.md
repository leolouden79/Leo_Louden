This is a Restruant App. 

It allows 2 types of accounts to be created: Restaurant Owners and Health Inspectors. 

Users interact with the app through the console using the scanner class.

When the user has completed a task the application's event loop allows the user to perform a new task.

Information is persisted using the JDBC interface and an Oracle Database Host on Amazon Web Services.

Restaurant Users can add or delete fridges, add food to fridges,  and grant health inspectors access to those fridges.

Health Inspectors can view the contents of any fridge they have access to and remove items from it.
