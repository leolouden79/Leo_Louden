# Rainy Day Reimbursements


This an Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) that manages the process of reimbursing insurance holders for expenses like rental cars and tow truck services. Insurance holders can login and submit requests for reimbursements and view their past tickets and pending requests. Policy managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all insurance holders. Policy managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for any pending reimbursements.
